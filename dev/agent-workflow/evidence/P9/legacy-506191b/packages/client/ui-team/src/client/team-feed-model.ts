/**
 * Pure projection of the leader-keyed team view into the "团队" tab's
 * event-stream section (D8g/D8h): the approval-chain and member-message
 * rows mixed into one ascending time order (oldest first), rendered capped
 * to the most recent `loadedCount` rows (default 200) with the "load
 * earlier" depth carried as a plain count.
 *
 * The loaded stream is the snapshot's representable stream (the full
 * approval history plus the snapshot's ≤500-message tail) plus the wire
 * pages the caller has fetched: `olderMessages`, the `messagesBefore`
 * pages strictly earlier than the snapshot window, already spliced in
 * global order (each page's anchor was the previously loaded oldest
 * message, so page after page runs older). The model re-sorts the whole
 * loaded set, so the splice stays globally ascending by construction.
 * Messages the fold observed but the loaded set does not hold are counted
 * in `unloadedMessageCount` — the fact behind the section's loud counted
 * note when a page load fails.
 *
 * The mixed order is (time ascending, kind, source order): an approval
 * anchors at its request time (its later decision updates the row in
 * place, the position never moves), a message at its own event time;
 * equal times put approvals before messages and keep the projection's
 * fold order within each kind (messages already arrive in their global
 * `(at, sessionId, seq)` order), so the result is deterministic for one
 * loaded set. `oldestMessage` is the loaded stream's oldest message —
 * the `messagesBefore` anchor the next wire page must name.
 *
 * React-free; the renderer supplies the snapshot, the load depth, and the
 * wire pages it has fetched.
