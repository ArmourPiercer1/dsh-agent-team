/**
 * P6-T4 — the durable control/approval vocabulary.
 *
 * Target state (Development Plan 19.4, Architecture 25):
 *
 * ```
 * ControlRequest durable in TeamDomain
 * ControlDecision durable in TeamDomain
 * actual tool operation still goes through DSH tool pipeline
 * ```
 *
 * This module defines the closed vocabulary of the control plane;
 * `service.ts` implements it over the injected TeamDomain repositories
 * (invariant 41: TeamDomain is the Team control-plane durable authority)
 * and the REUSED P6-T2 facade authority steps (`resolveTeamAndTarget` /
 * `resolveCaller` / `callerEnvelope` + `enforceEnvelope` — integration,
 * not a second authority path).
 *
 * Scope model (documented ruling; requirement: "an allow decision
 * authorizes exactly the requested operation scope"):
 *
 * ```
 * ControlOperationScope =
 *   (rootSessionId, targetInstanceId, actionName,
 *    toolName?, capabilityDomain?, correlation,
 *    operationFingerprint?)
 * ```
 *
 * - `targetInstanceId` — the instance the operation is addressed to
 *   (instanceId-first, invariant 18/19);
 * - `actionName` — the logical operation being requested (opaque,
 *   non-empty; e.g. a TeamRuntime action name or a tool-pipeline
 *   operation name);
 * - `toolName` — present when the operation is a DSH tool-pipeline
 *   operation (the last-mile guard's subject);
 * - `capabilityDomain` — optional explicit capability domain the operation
 *   exercises (closed `CapabilityName` set); ABSENT + `toolName` present
 *   means `tools`; ABSENT + no `toolName` means the external hard policy
 *   expresses no cell for the operation (the Team-owned admission that
 *   gated the request is the whole check);
 * - `correlation` — the caller's STABLE LOGICAL-OPERATION token (the
 *   requestToken): the identity that ties the request, the decision and
 *   the guarded tool call to ONE logical operation (Architecture 18.2);
 * - `operationFingerprint` — OPTIONAL (alpha.2 exact-scope extension):
 *   the resource + payload IMPACT identity of the operation (e.g. the
 *   canonical target resource + content impact of a write). ABSENT = the
 *   legacy scope identity (existing durable Control rows keep working
 *   unchanged); PRESENT = the approval is bound to the exact fingerprint.
 *   When present it participates in the scope's IDENTITY (the scope key
 *   and the decision-scope snapshot) and in the REQUEST IDEMPOTENCY key:
 *   two scopes identical except for the fingerprint are different scopes
 *   and never share a request, a decision or an allow. It is strictly
 *   SEPARATE from `correlation` (the logical invocation id, e.g. the tool
 *   callId): the fingerprint is NOT a correlation substitute — the same
 *   write content under a NEW correlation starts a NEW independent
 *   approval, and the same correlation under a DIFFERENT fingerprint is
 *   a different request (payload/resource mismatch is never reused).
 *
 * An allow decision is scoped to EXACTLY this tuple and is CONSUMED
 * EXACTLY ONCE by the last-mile guard (check-and-reserve under the
 * per-team lock): a second identical attempt — same tuple, same
 * correlation, same fingerprint — finds the consumed decision and is
 * BLOCKED; a new attempt at the operation must create a NEW control
 * request with a NEW correlation (no reuse).
 *
 * Synchronous wait bridge (alpha.2 §9.4): `ControlService.
 * awaitControlDecision` is the minimal liveness bridge over the SAME
 * durable rows — it polls the durable control state (the authority is
 * ALWAYS the durable rows; the waiter adds no authority) until a
 * decision for the requestId appears (resolve), the caller's signal
 * aborts (typed CONTROL_WAIT_ABORTED) or the durable control plane is
 * closed (typed CONTROL_WAIT_CLOSED). No durable waiter scheduler, no
 * cross-process continuation.
