/**
 * Alpha.5 P2 — the ONE mount entry point for a Member's compiled a5sf realm.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE ENTRY POINT: at the base of this package the two installers
 * (`installMemberIoProviders`, `installToolBindingRealm`) had NO production
 * caller — only the barrel re-export, the P1-05 suite and the R2 harness — so
 * the compiled realm was provable in-process and INERT in a Host. A P2 live
 * run's central facts ("the tool read through the Member's Provider", "the
 * guard was consulted") could therefore only be driver self-reports. This
 * module is the named seam a booted Host would call, in one place, for one
 * admitted Member: it mounts the Member ceiling realm and each admitted
 * tool-binding realm, and — when the caller supplies an observer — makes every
 * guard consultation observable and transportable (`guard-observability.ts`).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT: not a second launcher (the caller owns the root Context),
 * not a policy compiler (it consumes the SAME `CompileResult<MemberPolicy>` /
 * `EffectiveIoPolicy` objects P1-02 produced; it never re-evaluates a lane),
 * not a budget ledger, not an oracle, and not a decision. It composes the two
 * existing installers and adds rollback across them.
 *
 * ATOMICITY: if a binding realm fails to mount after the Member realm(s)
 * mounted, every binding mounted so far and the Member installation are
 * disposed before the typed install error propagates. `dispose()` is
 * idempotent and disposes bindings before Member ceilings.
 *

/**
 * One NATIVE tool module to re-mount INSIDE the Member's isolated `fs` scope.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (route C, 2026-11-03): the Agent preset registry mounts its
 * tool rows under the preset's STANDING scope, which is an ANCESTOR of the
 * agent scope; the definition a preset registers therefore resolves the preset
 * scope's `fs` (the base Provider). A registration made from the Member's own
 * isolated scope — `root.isolate('fs', label)`, whose DSH scope key is still the
 * agent's (`cordinate extend` inherits the scope tag) — SHADOWS that definition
 * for this agent only, and its body resolves the confined Provider. Mounting
 * the native module here is what makes the MODEL-VISIBLE native `read`/`write`/
 * `edit` execute on the confined lane. No Core patch, no copied tool body, no
 * second mount path: the module is the SAME package the preset mounted.
 *
 * The module is imported by the CALLER (row composition), never resolved here:
 * this seam must not own module-resolution policy (the same discipline that
 * keeps policy compilation out).
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING (review fix, 2026-11-03): the shadow must be created
 * AFTER the Member capability deny lane (`applyBuiltInToolDeny`). An OWN-scope
 * registration sits outside the inherited `tools.restrict` filter, so a deny
 * applied to the inherited surface BEFORE the shadow hides the preset row and
 * lets the shadow take its place; a deny applied AFTER the shadow cannot hide
 * it. The production glue therefore calls `mountNativeToolModules` after the
 * deny block, and the surface-neutrality check compares against the POST-DENY
 * surface.
